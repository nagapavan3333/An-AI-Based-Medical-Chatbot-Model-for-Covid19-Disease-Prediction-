# An-AI-Based-Medical-Chatbot-Model-for-Covid19-Disease-Prediction-
An AI-based chatbot that uses NLP and machine learning to predict the risk of COVID-19 based on user symptoms, providing instant health advice and awareness.
This project aims to develop an AI-based medical chatbot system capable of predicting the likelihood of a user being infected with COVID-19 based on their symptoms and other relevant health information. The chatbot will simulate intelligent conversation using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interact with users in real-time, gather symptom data, and use a machine learning model to assess the risk of COVID-19 infection.

The system is designed to support early detection and reduce unnecessary hospital visits by providing preliminary advice and directing users to appropriate health services if needed. It serves as a first-level triage tool to assist individuals during pandemics, especially in remote or under-resourced areas.

Key Features: Conversational Interface: A user-friendly chatbot that interacts using natural language to collect information.

Symptom Assessment: Gathers details about symptoms such as fever, cough, loss of taste/smell, fatigue, etc.

COVID-19 Prediction Model: A trained machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or neural network) that predicts the likelihood of COVID-19 based on symptoms and user history.

Risk Level Output: Provides a risk score (e.g., low, moderate, high) and gives advice accordingly.

24/7 Availability: Accessible anytime via web or mobile application.

Information Database: Offers updated information about COVID-19, safety protocols, vaccination, and testing centers.
